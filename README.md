# Smart_Vision

**Smart_Vision** is a mobile application(voice & gesture based) designed to empower visually impaired individuals by enabling independent interaction with their surroundings through real-time computer vision and audio feedback.

## Features

- **Object Detection**  
  Utilizes a YOLOv5 model to detect nearby objects and describe them via audio prompts, assisting users in obstacle avoidance, object recognition, and navigation.

- **Text Recognition (OCR)**  
  Integrates EasyOCR to read printed text from books, signs, or documents, converting it into speech for seamless and independent reading.

- **Currency Recognition**  
  Recognizes Indian currency notes using a combination of Hu Moments, Haralick textures, and color histograms, classified by a Random Forest model to aid in financial independence.

- **SOS Emergency Alerts**  
  Sends a voice/gesture-triggered SOS message with the user's geolocation to a predefined contact, providing a crucial safety mechanism.

- **Voice and Gesture Interface**  
  Operates entirely via simple voice commands and swipe gestures, ensuring ease of use without needing visual input.

## Purpose

Smart_Vision demonstrates the power of assistive technology to promote autonomy, safety, and inclusion for users with visual impairments. It combines cutting-edge AI with accessible design to deliver real-world impact.
